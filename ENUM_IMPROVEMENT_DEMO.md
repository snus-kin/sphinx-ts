# Enum Documentation Improvement Demo

This document demonstrates the improvement made to enum member documentation in the TypeScript Sphinx Extension, addressing issue #7.

## Problem Statement

**Issue #7**: "Nicer way of showing enum bodies / objects with documented members"

The original implementation displayed enum members as a raw TypeScript code block, which was described as "cheap" and made documentation hard to read and navigate.

## Before: Raw Code Block Approach

The previous implementation would generate documentation like this:

```html
<dl id="enum-HttpStatusCategory">
  <dt>export enum HttpStatusCategory</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Basic string enum for HTTP status categories.</p>
    <p><strong>Members:</strong></p>
    <div class="highlight-typescript">
      <pre>
/** Informational responses (100-199) */
INFORMATIONAL = "informational",
/** Successful responses (200-299) */
SUCCESS = "success",
/** Redirection messages (300-399) */
REDIRECTION = "redirection",
/** Client error responses (400-499) */
CLIENT_ERROR = "client_error",
/** Server error responses (500-599) */
SERVER_ERROR = "server_error"
      </pre>
    </div>
  </dd>
</dl>
```

### Problems with the old approach:
- **Poor readability**: All members cramped in a single code block
- **No individual member documentation**: JSDoc comments were just embedded as raw text
- **No cross-referencing**: Impossible to link to individual enum members
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Didn't match the style of other directives (classes, interfaces)
- **Limited navigation**: No way to jump to specific members

## After: Individual Member Documentation

The new implementation generates proper individual documentation for each enum member:

```html
<dl id="enum-HttpStatusCategory">
  <dt>export enum HttpStatusCategory</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Basic string enum for HTTP status categories.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<section id="enum-HttpStatusCategory-members">
  <h3>Members</h3>
  
  <dl id="enum-member-HttpStatusCategory.INFORMATIONAL">
    <dt class="sig sig-object ts">
      <span class="sig-prename">HttpStatusCategory.</span>
      <span class="sig-name">INFORMATIONAL</span>
      <em class="property"> = "informational"</em>
    </dt>
    <dd><p>Informational responses (100-199)</p></dd>
  </dl>

  <dl id="enum-member-HttpStatusCategory.SUCCESS">
    <dt class="sig sig-object ts">
      <span class="sig-prename">HttpStatusCategory.</span>
      <span class="sig-name">SUCCESS</span>
      <em class="property"> = "success"</em>
    </dt>
    <dd><p>Successful responses (200-299)</p></dd>
  </dl>
  
  <!-- ... additional members ... -->
</section>
```

### Benefits of the new approach:

✅ **Individual documentation entries**: Each enum member has its own documentation section  
✅ **Proper RST formatting**: JSDoc comments are parsed and formatted as proper reStructuredText  
✅ **Cross-reference support**: Members can be referenced via `:ts:enum_member:HttpStatusCategory.SUCCESS`  
✅ **Better navigation**: Table of contents includes individual members  
✅ **Consistent styling**: Matches the formatting of class methods and properties  
✅ **Enhanced readability**: Clean, structured presentation of each member  
✅ **Searchable content**: Individual members appear in search results  

## Real Example: HTTP Status Categories

Here's how the `HttpStatusCategory` enum appears in the documentation:

### Enum Declaration
```
export enum HttpStatusCategory
```
Basic string enum for HTTP status categories.

**Examples:**
```typescript
const status = HttpStatusCategory.SUCCESS;
console.log(status); // "success"
```

### Members

#### HttpStatusCategory.INFORMATIONAL = "informational"
Informational responses (100-199)

#### HttpStatusCategory.SUCCESS = "success"  
Successful responses (200-299)

#### HttpStatusCategory.REDIRECTION = "redirection"
Redirection messages (300-399)

#### HttpStatusCategory.CLIENT_ERROR = "client_error"
Client error responses (400-499)

#### HttpStatusCategory.SERVER_ERROR = "server_error"
Server error responses (500-599)

## Complex Example: Bit Flag Permissions

The improvement also handles complex enums like bit flags:

### Permission.READ = 1 << 0
Read permission

### Permission.WRITE = 1 << 1  
Write permission

### Permission.EXECUTE = 1 << 2
Execute permission

### Permission.DELETE = 1 << 3
Delete permission

### Permission.ADMIN = READ | WRITE | EXECUTE | DELETE
Admin permission (all permissions)

## Auto-increment Enums

For enums without explicit values, the new format cleanly shows just the member name:

### UserRole.GUEST
Guest user with no special permissions

### UserRole.USER
Regular user with basic permissions

### UserRole.MODERATOR
Moderator with elevated permissions

### UserRole.ADMIN
Administrator with full permissions

## Cross-Referencing Support

The new implementation adds support for cross-referencing individual enum members:

```rst
See :ts:enum_member:`HttpStatusCategory.SUCCESS` for successful responses.
Use :ts:enum_member:`Permission.READ` to grant read access.
The :ts:enum_member:`LogLevel.ERROR` level indicates errors.
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Removed raw code block generation** from `_add_enum_header()`
2. **Implemented `_add_enum_members_section()`** to create individual member documentation
3. **Enhanced `_format_enum_member()`** to use proper Sphinx documentation nodes
4. **Added enum_member object type** to the TypeScript domain
5. **Added `:ts:enum_member:` role** for cross-referencing
6. **Improved JSDoc comment parsing** for individual members

### Files Modified:

- `src/sphinx_ts/directives/enum_directive.py` - Main enum directive implementation
- `src/sphinx_ts/domain.py` - Added enum member support to domain
- `docs/examples.rst` - Added cross-reference examples

### Backward Compatibility:

✅ All existing functionality preserved  
✅ All tests continue to pass  
✅ No breaking changes to public API  
✅ Existing documentation builds without modification  

## Conclusion

This improvement transforms enum documentation from a "cheap" code block approach to a professional, structured documentation system that provides:

- **Better user experience** with individual member documentation
- **Enhanced navigation** through structured content
- **Improved cross-referencing** capabilities
- **Consistent formatting** with other TypeScript constructs
- **Better maintainability** through cleaner code structure

The fix successfully addresses issue #7 while maintaining full backward compatibility and improving the overall quality of generated documentation.
